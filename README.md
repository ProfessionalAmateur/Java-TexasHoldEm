Poker Game in Java (incomplete)
==================================

Overview
--------
While teaching myself Java I needed to write some code to fully grasp the language.  This is the project, a Texas Hold'em game written in Java.

What works:

1) Asks the user for the number of players  
2) Create a deck of cards  
3) Shuffle  
4) Cut the deck  
5) Deal players hole cards  
6) Burns a card  
7) Deals flop  
8) Burns a card  
9) Deals turn  
10) Burns a card  
11) Deals river  
12) Prints the deck to console to show random deck was used  
13) Prints the 'board'  
14) Prints burn cards  
15) Printers players cards  
16) Evaluates the value of each players hand (Royal flush, full house, etc...)   
  
I never finished the game, but it served it's purpose in helping me understand and use Java.
